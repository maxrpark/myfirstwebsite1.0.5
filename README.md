## This is my first website 1.0.5

I built this project because I wanted to practice working with API and I did not want to just create a simple project where I could just get random images.
I wanted to try something a little bit more difficult where I could also practice destructuring data.

I use this [API](https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API).
